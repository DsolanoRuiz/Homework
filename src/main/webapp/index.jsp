                     <p>The first phase of the project management initiation 
                        process is establishing an objective. This is when 
                        managers meet and decide what information they need 
                        from the project.  </p>

                        May also want to determine which demographic groups
                        of customers spend the most money. Demographics pertain
                        to consumers' incomes, genders or age groups. Objectives
                        are essentially the outcomes businesses wish to obtain
                        from completing projects. A manager must have a 
                        well-defined scope for a project to be successful, 
                        according to Reference for Business. In other words, 
                        all the objectives must be clearly defined. </p>
